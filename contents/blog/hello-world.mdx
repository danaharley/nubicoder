## Introduction

Hi, I feel happy to have finished building my personal website.

Going forward, I plan to share my knowledge and what I have learned recently about web development, especially front-end development and also showcase my projects.

For a personal website this is enough. It would be nice if there was a feature to track users who visit my site and update page views in real time and also implement SEO (Search Engine Optimization) so that the website gets a higher ranking in search engines like Google and much more. There will be additional features as time goes by.

In the future I will write a blog about how I built my personal website from scratch.

Ok. See you next time.. ^\_^
